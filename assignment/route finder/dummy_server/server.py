    With MinHeap and AdjacencyGraph in the same directory,
    this script can be run from the command line with the
    command: python3 server.py. The server can be interacted
    with sending requests in the format
    R <coordinateA1> <coordinateA2> <coordinateB1> <coordinateB2>
    and then pressing enter. Waypoints would be provided one at a
    time and requires Acknowledgement "A" everytime.
